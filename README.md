# Crystal Code Challenge

## Rust
I've included an executable which can be used as follows:

```bash
cd rust/
./age_count /path/to/file
```

If you want to build from source, install rust using rustup and build using cargo.
Here's the command to build:

```bash
cd rust/
cargo build --release
````

That will build an executable under *./target/release/age_count*.

## Node
I completed the assignment in Node first, because it's the language I'm most comfortable in. Make sure you have node installed and run with the following:

```bash
cd node/
node app.js /path/to/file
```
